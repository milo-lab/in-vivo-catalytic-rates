# in-vivo-catalytic-rates

This git repository holds scrips and numerical data to support the analyses performed for Davidi et al. 2016, regarding the chractariztion of in vivo catalytic rates of enzymes and their correspondance to in vitro kcat measurements. Note that we keep track of new published data to further improve the predictions of kmax values, thus resluts may change with time.
